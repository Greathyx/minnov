                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            A leading Asian company decided to expand its market in Nordic countries. Minnovation is
                            engaged by the customer from the earliest stage of its development in Europe, works along
                            with each other till now. Thanks to Minnovationâ€™s strong efforts and solid experiences in
                            human resources management and talent capabilities development, the company is now well
                            established in Nordic countries with great business achievements.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Ambition and Challenge</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            The company is a consumer electronics and smart manufacturing company , founded in 2010 and
                            listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2018. With its innovations,
                            high-quality user experience and operational efficiency, the company quickly becomes No. 1
                            in many of its focus areas in China, and No. 2 in smartphones in the world.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Its products are present in more than 100 countries around the world, however, its market
                            share in many strategic products in Nordic countries were yet to be enhanced. The sales were
                            developed purely through its agents or distributors.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The company has lots of successful achievements in China and other countries by setting up
                            its own stores in making strategic progress through end user experiences. In 2019, the
                            company decided to explore Sweden market as its first step in Nordic countries.

                        <h3>Strategy and Solution</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Minnovation worked closely with client representative since the first project kick-off
                            meeting. From defining requirements and objectives to feasibility studies, we involved
                            strongly in every steps. We provided advisory services on the overall strategy and
                            step-by-step establishment of its operations in Europe.
                        </p>

                            First consultants were dispatched from Minnovation, and we managed the legal compliance and
                            risks before the company had established its legal entity in the country. The full personnel
                            operations are with Minnovation including but not limited to employment, on-boarding,
                            payroll, and termination. Of course, the consultants are finally interviewed and selected by
                            the customer representative in meeting its requirement as well as the potential for future
                            development.

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Operating in a new country can have a short-cut by engaging an experienced and knowledgeable
                            consulting company. Minnovation has its expertise. We helped the customer to establish its
                            first Nordic branch company in Sweden.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            Nordic countries are famous for their complicated labor market and labor laws. It is one of
                            the most difficult area for a foreign company to establish it new presence here. To fully
                            prepare the customer for its self-operations, we worked closely with the customer on every
                            details in its operation process.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            When the customer has established its legal entity in Sweden and other Nordic countries, all
                            dispatched consultants are transferred to the new legal entity as its own employees. We
                            supported our customer with all the employees and leaders communications as well as needed
                            documentation such as new employment contracts.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            In the meantime, we also helped the customer to build up its own local human resources
                            management system, embedding the customerâ€™s global missions and values, while fitting well
                            into Nordic culture and compliance requirements.

                            A well operating human resource management system is a platform that automates most
                            processes throughout the employee lifecycle and facilitates employee management and boosts
                            employee engagement. HR related templates and processes might look simple, while they need
                            years of accumulated experiences and expertise in making them solid and efficient.

                            A leading telecom company decided to close its office in Nordic countries. Establishing a
                            business in a foreign country is not easy while exiting is even complicated especially in
                            Nordic countries. Minnovation successfully helped the customer to make the settlement well
                            and safe.

                            Our client is one of the largest telecom vendors that operate globally. However, the climate
                            of uncertainty pushed the company to close its branch offices in Nordic countries.

                            Well managed transformation needs a system approach and expertise in many areas. It requires

                            consultants worked closely with client representatives from the pre-separation strategy. We
                            stayed firm in clientâ€™s shoes. We started from analyzing workforce risks as an essential
                            first step. After rounds of client meetings and leaders interviews, we developed a framework
                            with the structure, tools and processes for the implementation.

                            the meantime, we helped the customers in arranging all outplacement activities including
                            trainings and other activities. Together with the client, we evaluated the remaining
                            business to determine potential workforce issues and mitigation strategies. With the high
                            trust from the client, our customized solutions were deployed in supporting its business

                            global talents and workforce into the Gigafactory became a huge challenge due to the
                            complexity of international mobilities.
